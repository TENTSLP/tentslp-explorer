# Translations

It is very important people can learn about SLP in their native language. We have used i18next to be able to provide translations on the site for users.


## Translating Site

If you would like to contribute to translating this site:

* Copy `lang/en.json` to a new file. 
* Translate the values in the file after the ":" symbol
* Open a PR or issue here, or contact `@Amitabha` on [Discord](https://discord.gg/78rVJcH)

## Fixing Error

If you noticed something that could be worded better:

* Look inside the `lang` folder for the corresponding [country code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#AD)
* Search for the phrase that has error
* Open a PR or issue here, or contact `@Amitabha` on [Discord](https://discord.gg/78rVJcH) with the fixed line.
